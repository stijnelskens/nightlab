# The development config uses a few different paths to load files.
# There is also only one image dimension specified by default.

# This dev environment should be accessed via a separate virtual host.
# An Apache example of such host configuration could be:
#
# <VirtualHost *:80>
#     DocumentRoot "<path_to_project>/dev"
#     ServerName dev.stitcher.local
#     ErrorLog "<log_path>/error.log"
#     CustomLog "<log_path>/access.log" common
#
#     <Directory "<path_to_project>/dev">
#         AllowOverride All
#         Require all granted
#     </Directory>
# </VirtualHost>

# Configure the paths of several directories
directories:
    # The source directory containing
    src: ../src

    # The public directory for the dev controller is used to save images
    public: ./

    # Cache directory used by smarty
    cache: ../.cache

    # Template directory
    template: ../src/template

meta:
    viewport: width=device-width, initial-scale=1

# Do not minify CSS or JavaScript
minify: false

# Configure engines
engines:
    # Choose the template engine. Available options: smarty, twig
    template: smarty

    # Use gd as image engine. Possible configurations: `gd` or `imagick`.
    image: gd

    # Don't optimize images. Disabling this option will increase the DevController's rendering speed,
    # but will render less optimised images.
    optimizer: false

caches:
    # Enable image caching while rendering
    image: true
