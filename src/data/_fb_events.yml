Now one year later, John Digweed returns to settle the score with a special Wednesday night before our public holiday on the following Thursday. \n\nJOHN DIGWEED * bedrock records - extended set.\nBP - lost & found * sudbeat - global underground - edge.\nERAN AVINER * plattenbank - sudbeat - edge.\n\ntickets are online: € 10\ntickets for last year canceled show are valid for this event.\n\n##############################\n\nabout:\n\nIf you’re not an avid follower of dance music but are tuned into popular culture at all you’ve likely experienced music touched by the hands of John Digweed.\n\nOriginally hailing from England but having clearly arrived on the global scene nearly a decade ago, John has long since cemented his name in the pages of dance music history. His list of achievements is groundbreaking, to say the least. \n\nHighlights would be the first proper DJ mix compilation (“Renaissance”, done with Sasha), being the first British DJ to hold a residency at what was then the world’s most well known club in NYC (Twilo, also with Sasha) as well as having remixed tracks by Danny Tenaglia, Underworld and New Order.\n\nJohn Digweed is a DJ's DJ. The beauty of what he does lies in just how different he really is from his contemporaries. From his early beginnings in Hastings, England at the age of 15 in the blossoming scene of acid house to the apex of the international dj'ing world, he has created and maintained a level of integrity that is the benchmark for both DJ's and producers globally. In fact, he has reached the very top of his profession, being voted #1 in a voter's poll by DJ magazine in 2001. John Digweed has become the people’s choice while maintaining his longstanding presence in underground dance culture. His popularity as both a DJ and a person seems to have no limits, but his efforts transcend dj'ing alone, he is as much a producer and promoter. His moniker “Bedrock” is his record label and promotions output and next to Ampere your host of this special night. \n\nhttp://www.johndigweed.com/\nhttp://bedrockmusic.bigcartel.com/"
