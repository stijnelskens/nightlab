        description: "Last year we sadly had to cancel this show due to the terrible terror attacks in Brussels. Now one year later, John Digweed returns to settle the score with a special Wednesday night before our public holiday on the following Thursday. \n\nJOHN DIGWEED * bedrock records - extended set.\nBP - lost & found * sudbeat - global underground - edge.\nERAN AVINER * plattenbank - sudbeat - edge.\n\ntickets are online: € 10\ntickets for last year canceled show are valid for this event.\n\n##############################\n\nabout:\n\nIf you’re not an avid follower of dance music but are tuned into popular culture at all you’ve likely experienced music touched by the hands of John Digweed.\n\nOriginally hailing from England but having clearly arrived on the global scene nearly a decade ago, John has long since cemented his name in the pages of dance music history. His list of achievements is groundbreaking, to say the least. \n\nHighlights would be the first proper DJ mix compilation (“Renaissance”, done with Sasha), being the first British DJ to hold a residency at what was then the world’s most well known club in NYC (Twilo, also with Sasha) as well as having remixed tracks by Danny Tenaglia, Underworld and New Order.\n\nJohn Digweed is a DJ's DJ. The beauty of what he does lies in just how different he really is from his contemporaries. From his early beginnings in Hastings, England at the age of 15 in the blossoming scene of acid house to the apex of the international dj'ing world, he has created and maintained a level of integrity that is the benchmark for both DJ's and producers globally. In fact, he has reached the very top of his profession, being voted #1 in a voter's poll by DJ magazine in 2001. John Digweed has become the people’s choice while maintaining his longstanding presence in underground dance culture. His popularity as both a DJ and a person seems to have no limits, but his efforts transcend dj'ing alone, he is as much a producer and promoter. His moniker “Bedrock” is his record label and promotions output and next to Ampere your host of this special night. \n\nhttp://www.johndigweed.com/\nhttp://bedrockmusic.bigcartel.com/"

        description: "A new edition of KNTXT, the techno concept hosted by Charlotte de Witte, is coming up with a - for the very first time - all night long set from our host. \n\nPS: The day after is a bank holiday! \n\n❭ ❭ ❭ LINE UP\n\n› Charlotte de Witte (Sleaze Records⎟Host)\n\nVisuals by Malika Maria at wOrk.\n\n--\n\nTICKETS: http://fuse.be/cevent/kntxt-w-charlotte-de-witte-all-night-long/\n\nDOORSALE: €15\n\n-- \n\nIf there’s one DJ about to take the world by storm, it’s Charlotte de Witte. Never shying away from a challenge, always malling her career and music the way she envisions it. And scorching through a myriad of uncompromising, agressive techno sets across Europe every single weekend. \n\nNo surprise then, that the rest of the world is calling for Charlotte. After already having toured Asia, the U.S. and Canada, she’ll be heading to Australia, New Zealand, Central and South America next. Few dj’s belong to the group that can work on that level - from the biggest stages to the sweatiest basement raves. \n\nStill her heart remains tied to the both the underground Techno scene and Belgium where she can be found championing new talent both on her Saturday night radio show, ‘Playground Charlotte de Witte’ on Studio Brussels, Belgium’s leading radio station, and at KNTXT de Witte’s residency at Brussels Techno institution Fuse.\n\nHaving moved into production, de Witte has wasted no time in establishing herself as a serious talent in the studio as well as behind the decks. But whilst a Charlotte de Witte DJ set is guaranteed to get you moving, Charlotte’s own music has provided her with a chance to reveal another side. \n\nHer agressive, stripped-down approach to her own tracks is a testament to that beforementioned dark side, while the tracks also often feature her own vocals. “Making music really gives me a chance to tap into the more emotional side of electronic music that I love. Music that has that melancholic side to it, I just find it so much more interesting, whether DJ’ing, producing or just listening myself at home.” \n\nHer release on Tiga’s Turbo Recordings “Weltschmerz EP” gained massive national and internatonal support. For now, with her upcoming releases, her ongoing radio show, Fuse residency and a packed tour diary de Witte shows no sign of slowing down. Despite her love of all things dark, the future for Charlotte de Witte looks very bright indeed. \n\nThis is only the beginning, it seems. “My Feeling”, from Charlotte’s follow-up EP on Turbo Recordings “Sehnsucht”, was Mixmag’s Track of 2016, the year in which Charlotte won Red Bull Elektropedia’s Award for best producer in her native Belgium. To top it all off, Trax Magazine dubbed her ‘nouvel espoir de la techno belge’ while Tsugi coined her “revelation for 2017”. \n\n--\n\nKNTXT /ˈkɒntɛkst/ noun\n\"The circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood.\""

        description: "Kompass presents ... \n\nBen Sims \nDasha Rush\n\nSupport by DJ David Asko\n\nWith over 20 years experience under his belt, Ben Sims has a well-deserved reputation as one of the world's most in-demand and leading techno DJs - a tight, energetic mixer who skilfully weaves together his own distinctive blend of tough funk and hardgrooves, often using three-deck wizardry and plenty of dexterity.\n\nDasha Rush is a Russian-born artist who sees the genre as a starting place, not a destination. She is a respected and well-traveled DJ and live performer, but her work is equally focused away from the dance floor, and sometimes away from the music itself. Combining her activities as a dj and techno producer on her Fullpanda imprint, which founded in 2005, with other multi-artistic collaborations alongside visual artists or dancers."

        description: "▦ BUTCH (DE, Otherside,Desolat)\nwww.soundcloud.com/superbutch \n▦ NICK CURLY (DE, 8-Bit, Cecille )\nwww.soundcloud.com/nickcurly\n▦ RAW DISTRICT (BE, Innervisions)\nwww.soundcloud.com/raw-district \n▦ UNCLESAND (BE, Proper Musique)\nwww.soundcloud.com/unclesand \n\nConstantly working in parallels - drenched by a potent mixture of juxtaposition and fluidity in both his sets and his productions - Bülent Gürler AKA BUTCH, fuses the grey-area space between music of the body and mind. With over 20 years consumed by a thirst for electronic music, the Alzey-born, Mainz raised entity has released on leading imprints such as Desolat, Cocoon, Rekids, Sei Es Drum and beyond, while maintaining a solid DJ schedule that’s seen him open the minds of crowds at fabric, Time Warp and his residency at Berlin’s Watergate. Techno heads love Butch, house heads love Butch, as well as the deep and dirty and the light & bright. Few artists flow through genres and emotional landscapes with such ease and fluidity as Bulent, challenging preconceptions of the dance-floor and the expected outcome in the process. The spark behind his excursions is natural: as a music lover he’s always stayed open to different styles and aesthetics. As an artist, he’s always allowed himself to express his take on each genre – it’s true that with Butch, you never know what to expect, other than consistently fresh and unique output. www.facebook.com/cometobutch/ \n\nEver since his memorable breakthrough in 2008, NICK CURLY has established himself as one of the pre-eminent international acts in the modern era of house music. Nick’s run of timeless, club-ready 12”’s and remixes have constantly and consistently found the mark amongst both music fans and his DJ peers. He currently stands at #4 in industry bible Resident Advisor’s most charted acts of all-time, sitting in alongside luminaries Maceo Plex, Butch, Radio Slave and Maya Jane Coles in the top 5, and he has become one of the world’s most in-demand DJs. The majority of Nick’s output has appeared on his own 8Bit label, as well as the now defunct – but memorable – Cecille Records. Industry titans such as Cocoon, Space Ibiza and Defected have all played significant roles in the Nick Curly story so far and continues into 2015 with Adam Beyer’s Truesoul imprint and Nick’s own ‘Trust’ parties coming into the mix and helping power his future. www.facebook.com/nickcurlyofficial/\n \nRAW DISTRICT is the fledgling house project from Belgian duo Vernon Bara and Massimo DaCosta. No newcomers to dance music, under the Vernon&DaCosta, the pair have released music on labels such as OM Records, AMA Rec, Robsoul, Aroma, OFF, Icon, Doubledown and many more. They have remixed artists including Brett Johnson, Fred Everything, Style of Eye, Miguel Migs and JT Donaldson, garnering support from great DJs like Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos, Jamie Jones, Mark Farina and DJ Sneak. Vernon has also made more techno-focussed tracks for Hot Creation and Supplement Facts under another moniker, Ultrasone alongside Igor Vicente. Early in 2013, they decided to start the new side project as ‘Raw District’ in order to focus on the deeper and darker side of house music. In their own words, “Raw District tracks feature fewer samples and more organic influences…the trademark soul, funk and disco influences are still evident, mixed up with the fresh European sounds coming straight out of Berlin.”  With a few releases on some of the most established labels such Crosstown Rebels, Souvenir Music or Defected they undoubtedly secured themselves as in-demand and talented producers.www.facebook.com/rawdistrict/ \n\nUNCLESAND is a duo of two guys. Two guys who have been friends for the past 2 decades. Both of them, Jens and Klaas, have been passionated about music for ages. That passion can be found in various musical projects where they appear solo or together and in 2013 their musical activities get a final form: Unclesand. Whipping up tech house with some minimal and techno influences is the very brief summary you could assign to their perfomances. With appearances at events such as Amsterdam Dance Event (Do Not Sleep ADE), Solar Weekend, Thé Dansant and in clubs like Labyrinth Club, Club Vaag, Café d'Anvers, Forty Five, Decadance, La Rocca where they shared decks with Marco Carola, Pan-Pot, Matthias Tanzmann, Anja Schneider, Cuartero, Darius Syrossian, Marco Faraone, Joris Voorn and many more. www.facebook.com/weareunclesand/ \n\n▦ Tickets www.labyrinthclub.be/tickets\n▦ Table reservations mail to: info@labyrinthclub.be\nFOLLOW US\nwww.instagram.com/labyrinthclubhasselt\nwww.twitter.com/labyrinthclubbe"
