The rich mix of these three corner stones is Flashmob and the results speak for themselves.\nHaving originally scored modern anthems Need In Me and Brick House for heavyweight labels Defected and Get Physical and felt full support from both the house and techno community, Flashmob continue to strive to deliver the perfect fusion of underground beats with crossover hooks that satisfy both the Saturday night crowd and Sunday morning community. \nThis unique combination has won them fans worldwide and each week Flashmob take to the skies to perform at amazing events at every country where serious sounds are enjoyed. With their rich heritage as music lovers for 20 years or more, Flashmob enjoy playing festival stages and underground rooms in equal measure – just as long as they are sharing their trademark future sound with friends old and new.\n\nIt’s this desire to share good music that led them in 2014 to the launch of their own label Flashmob Records which has now received support from Annie Mac on BBC Radio One, Maya Jane Coles, Disclosure, Dusky, Eats Everything, DJ W!ld, Tiga, Groove Armada and many more headliners. Tiga loved FMR001 so much he included it on his Mixmag covermount CD which was the ultimate accolade.\nIn addition they have releases and remixes on some of the world’s most respected labels including; Objektivity, DFTD, Viva, Avotre, Moon Harbour and W label which demonstrates just how central they are to the global underground movement. Every week a new connection is made and Flashmob work tirelessly to try and make the most of every opportunity from their favourite labels. \n\nThis prodigious output and upbeat approach to speaking to friends and fans have created a hardcore following and 2015 will see Danny and Alessandro reach new heights, and every milestone will be well earned…"

        description: "It is time to spread our lunar wings to discover new electromagnetic  horizons. We endeavor to reach out for strange new worlds and other foreign star systems, to grasp the unknown and to learn the darkest secrets the Universe holds back.\n\nFirst stop on our excursion: AMPERE. \n\n═════════════════════════\n\nWe’ll debark and set up camp at this planetary neighbour, which is located near a familiar extra galactical nebula, about some 5 billion light-years away from Planet K. Ampere is a pulsating interstellar metropole that attracts many voyagers traveling the cosmic sphere. Its size, mass, ecosystem and lifeforms are quite comparable to ours, and appears to have been formed at about the same time as our beloved Planet K. We’ll provide exclusively otherworldly techno. Expect shimmering soundwaves that are both dark and nuclear, raw and thriving.\n\nAmpere has recently collided with another asteroid called VØLT, that triggered a rich exchange with another traveling enterprise called 'We Play House'. Their civilization is in a stunningly high stadium. On the day we arrive, We Play House will celebrate their 10 years existence.   \n\n\nLINE-UP KOZZMOZZ ♦ MAIN ROOM \n═════════════════════════\n\n♦ MARCEL FENGLER  (Imf, Mote evolver.

As a DJ and producer, Marcel Fengler stands for imposing surprises and the appeal of variety. For him, techno is both unconditional passion as well as an essential part of his identity. He’s not bound to a linear or one-dimensional sound, instead, he’s constantly seeking for new ways to express his emotional storytelling skills. Marcel Fengler is withouta doubt one of today’s most exciting electronic artists, and we’re very honourd to welcome him again to our Kozzmozz-stage.\n \nSince his earliest productions, Amsterdam’s electronic music pioneer Steve Rachmad has created a legion of monikers for his various compositions. One of the main characters living on Planet Rachmad has always been STERAC: a side of Steve’s musical personality that’s not easily described. Let’s say that where other aliases were used for excursions to more dub-, disco-, or house- oriented records, STERAC’s focus has always been on the no-nonsense, darker, and deeper side of techno. The STERAC discography consists of classic tracks on labels such as M-Plant and Tresor, Klockwords and Delsin. Reinterpretations by Ricardo Villalobos and Marc Romboy to name a few, proved a big hit with fans and fellow artists, while his schedule takes him on a tour past the world’s finest clubs: from Berlin’s Berghain to Tokyo’s Womb, and from Output in New York to Club Rex in Paris. We’re very excited to see – and hear – what kind of techno madness he has in store for us. \n\nPfirter is one of Argentina's finest techno exports. Pushing a sound that is at once dark and uplifting, old school and fresh, he's gradually evolved into a club music all-rounder, DJing, producing and running one of techno's brightest imprints: MindTrip. He's put out massive records on the likes of CLR, Figure and Stroboscopic Artefacts,  released music from Oscar Mulero, Lucy, Chris Liebing, Tripeo and Markus Suckut and performed everywhere from Berghain and Tresor to Awakenings, I Love Techno and Time Warp. 2017 sees further development of his label with a select group of releases scheduled as well as the MindTrip Podcast. It is anyone's guess as to just how far Pfirter can continue to challenge and push himself and the wider techno scene. \n\nHis promising B2B-set with Kr!z will definitely form a musical highlight. The latter one has been a Kozzmozz resident for a long time and made his mark as the label head of the much hailed Belgian label, Token Records. With consistent and impressive DJ-skills, and a tendency for gloomy, dark and rawer sound of techno, he is a talented and capable artist in his own right. His busy DJ-schedule brings him all over the world, playing multiple times at Tresor and Berghain, to clubs reaching in Japan and Los Angeles.\n\nThe night starts off with Kozzmozz’ front-runner and longest resident Spacid. He’s promoting techno since the early 90’s but never ties down to one particular style. As a founder of the Funky Green Aliens collective, he promoted the more experimental side of techno. His thirst for renewal is illuminated by his passion for music, which keeps him sharp. This vision led him to be a connoisseur of sound, keeping him relevant as a DJ for more than 20 years."

        description: "https://goo.gl/PKNrGqhttps://goo.gl/PKNrGqSome Of Us Claim To Be Original, But We Are Still Playing House\n\nBelgium’s favorite underground house DJ Red D celebrates the 10 year anniversary of his We Play House Recordings label with a  celebration featuring Tama Sumo & Lakuti. Main room hosted by Kozzmozz\n\nBar Vølt - hosted by We Play House\n\nTama Sumo (ostgut ton _berghain _ panoramabar)\nLAKUTI (uzuri _ yore records\nRed D (we play house)\n\nTama Sumo is a German DJ based in Berlin, signed to the Ostgut Ton label and a regular at Berghain. Lakuti is a South African born DJ, booking agent, label boss, promoter and general industry all-rounder. Together they present a journey through the soulful side of house with a smidgen of jazz, soul and disco. \n\nWe Play House was born from the parties Red D (Bart Van Neste) held every month in Decadance. That was about 16 years ago, at the peak of funky house. He didn’t think that typical west coast sound was funky at all, instead, he wanted to go back to the more classical house music and put the emphasis on melodies again. That’s where the idea of starting his own record label started to grow. He met San Soda, who was making music at that time, and Bart thought his music was so original it just deserved a release. This year, the label is celebrating 10 years of We Play House Recordings and it’s still holding on to that same philosophy: original music with killer melodies that deserves to be released. Bart recently dug deep into his catalog, because the label is releasing a compilation featuring some of the most-wanted tracks. And that’s not all, every single artist that ever released on We Play House Recordings was asked to make a new track. Tonight they celebrate 10 years in the game at Ampere in Antwerp. \n\nMain Room - hosted by Kozzmozz \nRSVP: Kozzmozz on tour – Ampere (Antwerp)\n\nLine-up\n\nMarcel Fengler (Imf, Mote evolver.

        description: "What better better way to celebrate our one year existence than to throw a 17 hour Techno-party at our favorite techno venue Kompass?\nAnd OH YES, IT'S FREE.\n\nBerlin based live act & dj Stephan Hinz will be headlining our event. This well respected producer and member of Pan-Pot's imprint \"Second State\" is known for his bangin' live acts.\n\n✘ NIGHTTIME ✘ \n- Stephan Hinz [Live] (De, Second State, Drumcode)\n- Ode Maen\n- Massimo Mephisto\n- Phil Monday\n\n✘ DAYTIME ✘ Deep/melodic techno\n- Endove\n- Alexx \"Zander\" Johnson\n- Heckman B2B Phil Monday\n- Gank-crew (KennM B2B Mikka's Scar)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n➤Stephan Hinz \n\nAfter exploding onto the scene with ‘Doch’, arguably one of the best techno slammers of 2014, on Pan-Pot’s Second State imprint, Berlin-based Stephan Hinz’s career has been on a stratospheric rise. A talented live artist, Hinz is a master at the controls and an orchestral raconteur of the highest caliber. \n\nHis live sets deliver explosive original\nmaterial, leaving sweaty ravers in packed clubs wondering what the hell just happened.\n\n2016 was even more successful, with debut EPs on seminal labels such as Nicole Moudaber’s MOOD and Carl Cox’s Intec (the latter following a collaborative release with Philipp Ruhmhardt back in 2015), along with more new music on Second State,\nnotably the techno stomper ‘Venom’. These achievements join an impressive back catalogue from labels such as Adam Beyer’s Drumcode.\n\nHinz’s skill both in the studio and on the dancefloor have catapulted him from DJ’s favourite to the discerning clubber’s choice; as a result, he’s garnered impressive bookings worldwide with esteemed promoters including Awakenings, London Warehouse Events (LWE), LEAF London and HYTE, and bookings at prominent clubs such as Gashouder (Ams), Amnesia (Ibiza), Kristal Glam (RO), Watergate (DE) and Baum (Colombia).\n\nWhilst the last couple of years have been integral to the young producer’s success and reputation, his contribution to electronic music has always been diverse; after all, this is an artist whose love for classical and orchestral led him to apply for an internship with Hans Zimmer (he might still consider a call back!). His tenure hosting the eminent ‘DASDING Plattenleger’ radio show is now in its eighteenth year, and he composes music for film and television, including the upcoming film ‘2Close2u’\nwhich will be premiered at Canada Independent Film Festival in February 2017.\n\nHinz will continue to break new ground as a unique and powerful musical storyteller\nwith the release of his debut album this year.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/stephanhinzofficial/\nResident Advisor: https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/stephanhinz\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stephanhinz\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stephanhinz/\n\n➤Ode Maen\n\nBased in Ghent (Belgium) he started exploring and digging into an unknown musical world. This was the beginning of his musical diary. First influenced by the nineties, techno & progressive, that almost crossed the borders of well known radio hits to more deeper, darker, minimalistic & psychedelic sounds. \n\nTravelling from Belgium to Holland, Germany, Spain, Portugal and so on to keep getting inspired and amazed. As we speak he’s working on a more organic minimal techno vibe with the main purpose of sound and movement. He’ll always build up his sound with a skeleton of drums and loves to explore all the “out of this world” syntheses. \n\nBy this he also creates a sonic finesse suited in his energetic drum patterns. Allways looking for his signature sound he’s already recognized by hundred of dance floor lovers.\n\nA constant urge to deliver the highest quality in his musical spectrum to his crowd and himself makes him a passionate young man that keeps working on his sounds and lives on a professional way for this. \n\nhttps://odemaen.com/\n\n➤ Massimo Mephisto\n\nMassimo Mephisto is a Ghent based DJ.

Caught by the inspirational exploration of the electronic music scene and its appalling backstages, he decided to be part of it and to start performing behind the decks himself.\nThis led to the birth of Endove in 2014, and a maturing sonic signature nurtured by dark, groovy but still melodic techno that takes the dancefloor audience on a heavenly journey throughout the night.\nHaving spearheaded club Søndag for over a year, he got further inspirited and involved in joint projects with fellows like Kortryk and Primitive People.\nIf warm ups and closings have no secret for him in venues such as Labyrinth Club, Café d'Anvers, Decadance, De Kreun and festivals like Cirque Magique and Voltage Festival, he also played next to big headliners like Marcel Dettmann, Paul Ritch, Alex Niggeman, Einmusik, Reboot, Monoloc, Dax J, Johannes Heil, Dense&Pika, Charlotte De Witte, Amelie Lens, Woo/York, Makam, Konstantin Sibold, Hunter/Game,...

Not only could he play the tracks he loved, he now had found a way to share his passion with others. \n\nIn the years that followed Sil was known as SILEKTRO and had the chance to play at some great clubs and venues including Tomorrowland (2011), Houza Palooza (2011), The Place (Ibiza) (2013), La Rocca (2013), Culture Club, Aper’eau,… \n\nIn 2013 Sil went studying music production and advanced djing at Point Blank in London to keep improving and to keep working on his skills as a dj and producer. \n\nAlong the way Sil kept working on developing his own sound and with finding the true sound he loves and wants to share he decided to change his name to Heckman.

With his signature sound, he has created a shift in the direction of underground electronic music, starting a movement of atmospheric bass-line driven techno that is entirely unique and unmistakable. It has come almost exclusively on Richie Hawtin’s Minus, and with that label he has been an influential part of the modern day techno landscape, both on stage and in the studio. From pioneering Minus projects like Contakt and CNTRL, to being a key resident of ENTER via his always inventive live sets and mind bending visual accompaniments, Gaiser has always harnessed the power of electronic music and nurtured its most evocative and cinematic possibilities. www.facebook.com/GaiserMusic/\n\nRAW DISTRICT is the fledgling house project from Belgian duo Vernon Bara and Massimo DaCosta. No newcomers to dance music, under the Vernon&DaCosta, the pair have released music on labels such as OM Records, AMA Rec, Robsoul, Aroma, OFF, Icon, Doubledown and many more. They have remixed artists including Brett Johnson, Fred Everything, Style of Eye, Miguel Migs and JT Donaldson, garnering support from great DJs like Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos, Jamie Jones, Mark Farina and DJ Sneak. Vernon has also made more techno-focussed tracks for Hot Creation and Supplement Facts under another moniker, Ultrasone alongside Igor Vicente. Early in 2013, they decided to start the new side project as ‘Raw District’ in order to focus on the deeper and darker side of house music. In their own words, “Raw District tracks feature fewer samples and more organic influences…the trademark soul, funk and disco influences are still evident, mixed up with the fresh European sounds coming straight out of Berlin.” With a few releases on some of the most established labels such Crosstown Rebels, Souvenir Music or Defected they undoubtedly secured themselves as in-demand and talented producers. www.facebook.com/rawdistrict/\n\nBorn in Bonn, Germany, ANDRE BULJAT has been obsessed with music since an early age. By the time he was 12, he was experimenting on his first mixer and turntables mainly mixing hip-hop & rap while living in the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean. At the age of 15 he was introduced to electronic music through attending and assisting in the organization of many underground House and Techno parties in the Dominican Republic.It all began to come together in 2004, when he moved to Barcelona, which ended up being the place where he completely established into local’s electronic music scene, taking part of all sort of collectives and parties and also getting an exponential growth on his international schedule playing alongside artists like Ricardo Villalobos, Mathew Jonson, Marco Carola, Dubfire or Sven Väth. Over the years some of his several remixes and productions have been released on labels the likes Serialism, CB Sessions, N.19 or Intacto Records and his own label Yakazi. www.facebook.com/andrebuljat/\n\n▦ Tickets www.labyrinthclub.be/tickets\n▦ Table reservations mail to: info@labyrinthclub.be\n\nFOLLOW US\nwww.instagram.com/labyrinthclubhasselt\nwww.twitter.com/labyrinthclubbe"

From 2005 Gui Boratto began to dedicate himself to his own productions and compositions, displaying to the public an authoral and more personalized side to his abilities. With countless licenses with respected European labels, such as Plastic City, Circle, Kompakt, Audiomatique, among others, Gui Boratto has managed to appear in the chart and playlists of people like Michael Mayer, Tiefschwarz, Steve Bug, Phonique, Martin Landsky, Hernan Cattaneo, among others. With respect for his talent growing in the world scene, Gui Boratto is a name to look out for on the Brazilian house, techno and minimal scene. www.facebook.com/guiboratto/\n\nSince 2000, starting out of DkA, several side-projects such as 'Brussels Pony Club', 'Comute' or 'Kelket' have already been realized, highly appreciated, signed and finally released by various labels such as Lift Your Head Up, Blank Slate or Paranoid Dancer. Beeing inspired by Hiphop-, 70’s Funk - and Jazz music, DkA tends to merge all this influences whilst maintaining a solid minimal tech and deep house feeling. For serveral years now, the belgian producer DkA is traveling all over Europe in order to perform in clubs such as Watergate, The Zoo Channel, Kater Holzig, Sisyphos, Ritter Butzke, Prince Charles, Badaboum, Machine du Moulin Rouge, Fuse, Labyrinth, Spartacus or Café d’Anvers.

After several years of having their fixed and undisputed place at most of the FloorFiller events, their sets have become notorious-like to the crowd. Joyhauser holds up an arsenal of hard-hitting beats accompanied with captivating and melancholic strings. Their sophisticated array of refined sounds can truly be recognized in both their sets and productions. Eventually, they somehow always find a way to bring a unique analog epos to the listener, which is the exact reason why Joyhauser is still one of the key artists of the FloorFiller collective. www.facebook.com/joyhau5er\n\nUNCLESAND have been friends for the past 2 decades. Both of them, Jens and Klaas, have been passionated about music for ages.
